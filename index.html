<div class="project">
	<h3>Asteroids</h3>
	<p class="descpara">
		In this project, I sharpened my C# skills by recreating the game Asteroids 
		using the Unity game engine. One of the challenges of this project was 
		handling the movement of the ship which continues to glide even when no 
		buttons are being pushed, unlike the movement in most video games. The 
		process of recreating a game required me to understand the requirements of
		the project by experience, rather than have them stated and to create code
		that satisfied those requirements.

	<h3>COVID-19 Infection Rates</h3>
	<p class="descpara">
		The <a target="_blank" href="https://covidactnow.org/"> 
		COVID ActNow</a> website provides data about the spread
		of COVID-19. Using COVID ActNow's API, I created a Google Colab Notebook that
		compares the infection rates of each state. My Notebook condenses data that
		is found on multiple pages on the COVID ActNow website into one page.

<div class="project">
	<h3>Steganograpy</h3>
	<p class="descpara">
		Steganography is hiding a message in a way that it is not obvious that a
		message have been encoded. I find the subject to be very interesting so I
		decided to create a program using the concept of least significant bit
		encoding to encode an image inside another image. For this project, I
		learned about how different methods of steganography work and then created
		a program that implemented one of the algorithms I learned about.

<div class="project">
	<h3>Sudoku Solver</h3>
	<p class="descpara">
		Sudoku puzzles are a very popular puzzle where the solver places numbers in
		squares so each row, column, and region (a 3 x 3 grid) only contains one of
		each digit. I created a Sudoku solver using Visual C# in Microsoft Visual
		Studio. In this project, I expanded on what I have learned in my data
		structures classes by developing my own data structure to handle the values
		for each square of a Sudoku puzzle. Solving the puzzle requires a data
		structure where each square is contained in its own combination of row,
		column and region. The challenge of this project was translating the
		process of solving a Sudoku puzzle into code that a computer can understand.

	<h3>Secure Assess</h3>
	<p class="descpara">
		As part of my senior project, I worked in a group of 8 people to develop
		a mobile app that will keep a user informed about computer security issues
		with a knowledge base and communication forum. The project was done
		in React Native.

	<h3>Accessibility Exposure & Impact Score Project</h3>
	<p class="descpara">
		As part of a software engineering class, I worked in a group of 5 people
		to develop a website to help the California Department of Rehabilitation
		evaluate the impact of improving accessibility of the department's systems.
		The project was done in C#.
