	<div class="project">
		<h3>Asteroids</h3>
		<p>
			In this project, I sharpened my C# skills by recreating the game Asteroids 
			using the Unity game engine. One of the challenges of this project was 
			handling the movement of the ship which continues to glide even when no 
			buttons are being pushed, unlike the movement in most video games. The 
			process of recreating a game required me to understand the requirements of
			the project by experience, rather than have them stated and to create code
			that satisfied those requirements.

		<h3>COVID-19 Infection Rates</h3>
		<p>
			The COVID ActNow website ( covidactnow.org ) provides data about the spread
			of COVID-19. Using COVID ActNow's API, I created a Jupyter Notebook that
			compares the infection rates of each state. My Notebook condenses data that
			is found on multiple pages on the COVID ActNow website into one page.

	<div class="project">
		<h3>Steganograpy</h3>
		<p>
			Steganography is hiding a message in a way that it is not obvious that a
			message have been encoded. I find the subject to be very interesting so I
			decided to create a program using the concept of least significant bit
			encoding to encode an image inside another image. For this project, I
			learned about how different methods of steganography work and then created
			a program that implemented one of the algorithms I learned about.

		<h3>Sudoku Solver</h3>
		<p>
			Sudoku puzzles are a very popular puzzle where the solver places numbers in
			squares so each row, column, and region (a 3 x 3 grid) only contains one of
			each digit. I created a Sudoku solver using Visual C# in Microsoft Visual
			Studio. In this project, I expanded on what I have learned in my data
			structures classes by developing my own data structure to handle the values
			for each square of a Sudoku puzzle. Solving the puzzle requires a data
			structure where each square is contained in its own combination of row,
			column and region. The challenge of this project was translating the
			process of solving a Sudoku puzzle into code that a computer can understand.

		<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
		<p>
			For my Tic Tac Toe project, I implemented a simple computer opponent. It
			will block the player when the player has two in a row and will make the
			winning move when the computer has two in a row. For this project, I
			practiced updating the state of the program based on user input and using
			that state to determine the action the computer should take. I used JavaFX
			to implement the GUI and used Eclipse as my IDE.

	<div class="project">
		<h3>Secure Assess</h3>
		<p>
			As part of my senior project, I worked in a group of 8 people to develop
			a mobile app that will keep a user informed about computer security issues
			with a knowledge base and communication forum. The project was done
			in React Native.
		</p>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>Accessibility Exposure & Impact Score Project</h3>
		<p>
			As part of a software engineering class, I worked in a group of 5 people
			to develop a website to help the California Department of Rehabilitation
			evaluate the impact of improving accessibility of the department's systems.
			The project was done in C#.
