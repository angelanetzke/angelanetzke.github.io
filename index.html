	<h2>Steganograpy</h2>
	<p>
		Steganography is hiding a message in a way that it is not obvious that a message have been encoded.
		I find the subject to be very interesting so I decided to create a program using the concept of 
		least significant bit encoding to encode an image inside another image. For this project, I learned
		about how different methods of steganography work and then created a program that implemented one of
		the algorithms I learned about.

	<h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
	<p>
		Sudoku puzzles are a very popular puzzle where the solver places numbers in squares so
		each row, column, and region (a 3 x 3 grid) only contains one of each digit. I created a
		sudoku solver using Visual C# in Microsoft Visual Studio. In this project, I expanded on what 
		I have learned in my data strutures classes by developing my own data structure to handle
		the values for each square of a sudoku puzzle. Solving the puzzle requires a data structure
		where each square is contained in its own combination of row, column and region. The challenge
		of this project was translating the process of solving a sudoku puzzle into code that a computer
		can understand.

	<h2>Asteroids</h2>
	<p>
		The C# programming language has many applications. One of these is the Unity game engine.
		In this project, I sharpened my C# skills by recreating the game Asteroids. One of the challenges
		of this project was handling the movement of the ship which continues to glide even we no buttons
		are being pushed, unlike the movement in most video games.
