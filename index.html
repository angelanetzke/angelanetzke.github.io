	<h2>Asteroids</h2>
	<p>
		In this project, I sharpened my C# skills by recreating the game Asteroids 
		using the Unity game engine. One of the challenges of this project was 
		handling the movement of the ship which continues to glide even when no 
		buttons are being pushed, unlike the movement in most video games. The 
		process of recreating a game required me to understand the requirements of
		the project by experience, rather than have them stated and to create code
		that satisfied those requirements.

	<h2>Steganograpy</h2>
	<p>
		Steganography is hiding a message in a way that it is not obvious that a
		message have been encoded. I find the subject to be very interesting so I
		decided to create a program using the concept of least significant bit
		encoding to encode an image inside another image. For this project, I
		learned about how different methods of steganography work and then created
		a program that implemented one of the algorithms I learned about.

	<h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
	<p>
		Sudoku puzzles are a very popular puzzle where the solver places numbers in
		squares so each row, column, and region (a 3 x 3 grid) only contains one of
		each digit. I created a Sudoku solver using Visual C# in Microsoft Visual
		Studio. In this project, I expanded on what I have learned in my data
		structures classes by developing my own data structure to handle the values
		for each square of a Sudoku puzzle. Solving the puzzle requires a data
		structure where each square is contained in its own combination of row,
		column and region. The challenge of this project was translating the
		process of solving a Sudoku puzzle into code that a computer can understand.

	<h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
	<p>
		For my Tic Tac Toe project, I implemented a simple computer opponent. It
		will block the player when the player has two in a row and will make the
		winning move when the computer has two in a row. For this project, I
		practiced updating the state of the program based on user input and using
		that state to determine the action the computer should take. I used JavaFX
		to implement the GUI and used Eclipse as my IDE.
